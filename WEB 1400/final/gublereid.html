				<p class="left">This is my main and first account that I made. I almost have all the champions on it, but because I play on different accounts it has been difficult to collect them all. I have been in my Diamond IV promos 3 times. Please boost me in duos if you are a higher rank than I am.</p>

					<p class="left"><br>Ezreal is a fun champion to play because of hit abilities. He contains all skillshots so he carries a lot of risk with reward. I play him a lot because it is easy to stay alive while dealing damage without relying too heavily on your team. He is popular in Korea because of what the player "Bang" can do with him. Many that play against Bang in competitive consider Ezreal to be a pick/ban.</p>

    				<p class="left text"><br>Vayne is a lot of fun becuase of her interaction between her ultimate ability and her Q. It allows the user to go stealthed and almost impossible to hit. Any type of point and click ability won't hit her, but skillshots will land. Due to her ultimate, she has a lot of room to make amazing plays that will leave the enemy team shaking in their boots. Getting ahead on this champion early can usually bring a victory, but due to her lower resistances and attack range it can be difficult.</p>
