			<p class="left text"><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/" target="_blank">League of Legends</a> is a the most popular video game in the world. It has been around since late 2009 and has remained a popular MOBA in North America and Asia. Despite being only one map, there are plenty of champions so that no game ever feels the same. With how many players there are, game can always be found within two minutes and can lead to some of the most fun and most depressing times I have ever had. I have been playing it since the summer of 2013 and I don't plan to stop anytime soon.</p>
